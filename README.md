# Task of SotaTek_KR (FE / PM)

## Goal

- create a simple game where you are walking along a trail. 
- You begin your adventure at the bottom of the trail and you hike your way up to the top.
- If you turn around you are facing the other direction. 

## Git

- Commit to GitHub 
- Use single-purpose commits 
- Use [semantic commit messages](https://gist.github.com/joshbuchea/6f47e86d2510bce28f8e7f42ae84c716)
 

## Code

- Use your framework (React, Vue, or Angular) 
- Use Typescript and strongly typed code 
- For design use, Ionic Framework is a plus 
- Unit test is a plus 

## Structure

- All the images will be as a JSON file, you must determine the structure

## Report

- Record how many hours you spent on the project 
- Record what you would improve on if you had more time. 
- Include these in the README.md 

## Assets

- Here are the [pictures](https://photos.app.goo.gl/ioPLWRSakbctgLkb8)

## Design

 - Works on a phone (it is still a website but is mobile first) 
-  Works as a desktop (responsive design) 
- It has scroll left and right buttons that scroll the background image left or right. 

- Has a button over the trail that if you press it you walk there. Like google street view  but simpler
